AI- BASED-DIET-PLAN-RECOMMENDATION-

This project implements an AI-based diet recommendation system designed to generate personalized diet plans based on user inputs like weight, age, activity level, medical conditions, and dietary preferences.
The system uses a machine learning algorithm to classify users into different categories and recommends suitable diet types.



Project Description:

This project uses data from various users, including their weight, height, age, gender, and medical history, to predict the best diet plan for each individual. Using a Random Forest Classifier, the system classifies users based on features such as their BMI, BMR, activity level, and dietary restrictions. The model provides users with an optimal calorie intake and recommends a diet type (e.g., Vegan, Non-Vegetarian) suited to their goals (e.g., weight loss, muscle gain).



Goal:

1. To recommend a personalized diet plan.
2. To improve the overall health of individuals by providing tailored nutritional advice.


Technologies Used:


1. Python: Primary programming language.
2. pandas: For data cleaning and manipulation.
3. scikit-learn: For model training, testing, and evaluation.
4. matplotlib: For data visualization (e.g., feature importance chart).
5. joblib: for saving the trained model
6. Jupyter Notebooks: For model development and testing.
7. RandomForestClassifier: Machine learning model used for predictions.


Features:


1. Personalized Diet Plans: Based on user's personal data (age, weight, activity level, etc.).
2. Health Considerations: Takes into account medical history like cholesterol level and blood pressure.
3. Activity Level: Considers the userâ€™s activity level for more accurate calorie intake predictions.
4. Diet Type Recommendations: Recommends diet plans (e.g., Vegan, Non-Vegetarian, Vegetarian) based on goals (weight loss, muscle gain).


How It Works:


1. Data Collection: The system collects user data like age, weight, height, gender, and more.
2. Preprocessing: The input data is cleaned, transformed, and normalized (if needed).
3. Feature Engineering: Important features are selected and one-hot encoding is applied for categorical variables.
4. Model Training: A Random Forest Classifier is trained using labeled data to predict diet categories.
5. User Input: Users can enter their details, and the model predicts the appropriate diet plan and calorie intake.
6. Output: The system displays the personalized diet plan, including daily calorie intake and recommended food types.
